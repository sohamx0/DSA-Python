""" HOW IT WORKS ?
1. The outer loop iterates through each index of the list, treating it as the current position to fill with the smallest unsorted element.
2. The inner loop finds the smallest element in the remaining unsorted part of the list.
3. The smallest element is then removed from its current position and inserted at the correct sorted position.
4. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.
