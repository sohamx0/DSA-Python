""" HOW IT WORKS ?
1. The outer loop iterates through each element starting from the second one (index 1).
2. The inner loop compares the current element with the elements in the sorted part (to the left) and finds the correct position for it.
3. The current element is then inserted into its correct position, shifting other elements as necessary.
4. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.
